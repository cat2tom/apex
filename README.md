# APEX/F

APEX/F is an experimental radiotherapy treatment planning platform designed to aid oncologists. It uses sophisticated image analysis (using fractal mathematics and watershed image processing) in order to do this.

APEX/F is currently undergoing trials at the [University Hospital of North Staffordshire](http://www.uhns.nhs.uk) and the [Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine](http://www.keele.ac.uk/istm/) and is forming part of several upcoming publications.
